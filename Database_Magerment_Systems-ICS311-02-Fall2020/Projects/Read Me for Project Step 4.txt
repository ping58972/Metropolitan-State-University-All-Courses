Create local Database:

In MySQL work bench:

Create new connection with local database:

Network address: 127.0.0.1

User: root

Password: ABoody1994!!

Then run the my attached "videogame database script.sql" script inside the new connection to create the database that my app will connect to.



To run the .java files:

1.create a new java project with any name

2.create 4 new classes within the new project with the names: "db", "gui","db2", gui2"

3.copy and paste the contents of each .java files that I submitted into the corresponding class names that you created. 
   For example: copy the code content from my "db.java" file into your "db" class.

4.You need to add the jar file to your project Build Path.
	 In Eclipse:
	Project->Properties->Java Build Path -> Add External jars 
	Choose the jar file in the folder “MySQL\Connector J 5.1”

5.Then right click on "db.java" or "db2.java" in your package explorer path > Run as > Java Application.

db.java contains Part 1 of the project: Has the data from the "game" table

bd2.java contains Part2 of the project: has the data from the store and the purchase_order tables 
which shows store code, store name, store manager, order num, and order date for every order made.

6. in each form there will be "Next" "Previous" "Last" "First", these buttons are used to navigate through the table inside the form GUI

"Next" will show the next row of the table
"Previous" will show the previous row of the table
"Last" will show the last row of the table
"First" will show the first row of the table
