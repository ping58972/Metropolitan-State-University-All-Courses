AB  - Ladyboy refers to transgender women. The partners of ladyboys are heterosexually identified men. The term is used primarily in Thailand and the Philippines, and is most commonly associated with beauty pageants, tourism, and sex work. Thus, the label can have negative connotations and should be used with care. Although there is high tolerance for ladyboys, they continue to face discrimination and structural impediments to their life opportunities.
