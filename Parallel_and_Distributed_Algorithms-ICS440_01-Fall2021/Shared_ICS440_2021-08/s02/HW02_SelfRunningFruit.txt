HW02
 - write two classes: Fruit and FruitDemo
 - both classes shall be in the package: com.abc.fruit

Fruit class
 - Fruit shall be a self-running object (that is, it starts up
   an internal thread during construction).
 - The constructor for Fruit shall take a single argument of
   type String which is the name of the instance:
     public Fruit(String name) { //...

 - The internal thread for a Fruit instance shall print the
   name supplied at construction 20 times, each time on a 
   line by itself (System.out.println(name)). Optionally, the
   internal thread may sleep for a short period of time
   between printing lines.

FruitDemo class
 - FruitDemo is run (that is, it has the main() method).
 - Inside main(), create at least two instances of Fruit
   each with a different name.
 - When run each instance shall print 20 lines of output.
 - Adding Thread.sleep(long) calls inside Fruit will show
   more clearly that two threads are running at the same
   time, but as stated earlier, the sleep part is optional.
