 * General rules for how pass/receive work
 * 
 * Pass
 * 	1. Check for interrupts / shutdowns / if the passing slot has already been taken
 * 	2. Set flag that pass has been initiated
 * 	3. Set flag that pass is ready to begin handshake with receive
 * 	4. Wait until receive is ready **
 * 	5. Set message variable
 * 	6. Set flag that message variable has been set
 * 	7. Wait until message has been received **
 * 	8. Exit method, resetting object's variables
 * 
 * Receive
 * 	1. Check for interrupts / shutdowns / if the receiving slot has already been taken
 * 	2. Set flag that receive has been initiated
 * 	3. Set flag that receive is ready to begin handshake with pass
 * 	4. Wait until pass is ready **
 * 	5. Wait until message has been set **
 * 	6. Read message into local variable
 * 	7. Set flag that message has been received
 * 	8. Exit method, resetting object's variables
 * 
 * 	** ANY/ALL waiting is followed by a check for any interrupts/shutdowns that may have occurred while waiting
 * 
 * Timeout methods
 * 	The timeout given for pass/receive is assumed to be the maximum amount of time to wait for the handshake to initiate.
 * 	Later waits, i.e. when waiting for the message to be set/read, are assumed to be negligible in length because the handshake has begun and
 * 	these waits are only in place to ensure that the message variable is set before being read, and not cleared until after it is read.
 *
