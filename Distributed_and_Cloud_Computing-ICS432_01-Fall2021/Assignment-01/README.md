**Summarize your learning:**

I have learned to create and launch a EC2 instance of virtual machine in
AWS by web page and terminal command line SSH, and learned how to deploy
a web server to run in AWS in the Linux which I have created, then
install a nginx web server software on the EC2 instance. Then, modified
the security setting of the instance to allow public access for other
people can access the website that I created. Finally, I have to stop
the EC2 instance to terminate the cost for my account bill.

The most important thing is I have familiar with AWS EC2 instance
virtual machine that is every significant concept of current technology
and most popular use to deploy our modern website and other applications
these day.

I think the most challenge me about working with AWS EC2 instance is
working on the stable connection of internet to keep connect from my
computer to a remote machine, AWS. And I have to familiar with the
environment system, Linux, command line and system file of Linux, that
is every challenge for me in the beginning.

Exercise 2: Data Analysis using SQL on a GCP Virtual Machine.

**Summarize your learning:**

I have learned to create and launch a VM instance on GCP by web page and
terminal command line SSH on the web page command line interface, and
learned how to set up My SQL server on the virtual machine of Linux
which I have created, then fill tables with a data set about movie
reviews. After that, write SQL queries to analyze a movie-rating data
set. Finally, I have to stop the VM instance to terminate the cost for
my account bill.

The most important thing is I have familiar with VM instance GCP virtual
machine that is every significant concept of current technology and most
popular use to analyze big data and other like machine learning and data
analyze for data science.

I think the most challenge me about working with GCP's VM instance is
working on the stable connection of internet to keep connect from my
computer to a remote machine on GCP. And I have to write SQL queries
with the environment system, Linux, command line and under system file
of Linux, that is every challenge for me in the beginning.
